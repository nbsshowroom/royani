If life is a journey, we invite you to walk it with us. Situated in the heart of Whitefield, Brigade Lakefront is well connected to various schools, offices, cultural meeting places and parks. But what sets it apart is the space there is around your home where you can simply walk.
There are 2, 3 and 4 bedroom apartments ranging from 1330 to 3360 square feet. And all residents have access to the 30,000 squarefoot clubhouse with its rooftop swimming pool, various sporting facilities, large open green spaces to walk about in, a childrenâ€™s play area and even a senior citizens court.
