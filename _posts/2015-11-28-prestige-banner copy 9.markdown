Brigade Omega homes are right across from the Thurahalli Forest Reserve off Kanakapura Road. Set in a six-acre property, there is space enough to breathe, play, run and enjoy the freedom of movement. 
Rich in verdure, this Brigade property houses a jogging trail through the campus, a gym, badminton court, a swimming pool and plenty of open areas to explore and wander at will. Additionally, spread over the campus are parks and open spaces. There are three towers and 520 apartments at Brigade Omega. The 2, 3 and 4 bedroom apartments are designed to maximise light and ventilation, and range in area from 1290 square feet to 2390 square feet.
